[Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) is a tool for speeding up your tests by preloading a Rails app.
[parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) also speeds up your tests by running them, well,
in parallel. Two good gems, so why not to use them together? Let's make our CPUs sweat!

## Show me the numbers!

### RSpec

```
$ time rspec spec

## Installation
  
[RailsCast episode #413 Fast Tests](http://railscasts.com/episodes/413-fast-tests)  

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zeus-parallel_tests'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

You need also to initialize your project with custom Zeus plan:

    $ zeus-parallel_tests init

This will create two files in your project:

* custom_plan.rb
* zeus.json

### RVM

For RVM users it is recommended to install rvm-bundler gem.

## Usage

First [follow instructions](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) and prepare
your application to use parallel_tests.

Launch another terminal and run zeus' master process:

    $ bundle exec zeus start

Then you can run your parallel specs:

    $ zeus parallel_rspec spec

or your cucumbers:

    $ zeus parallel_cucumber features

## What is supported?

* rspec
* cucumber
* guard-rspec (just pass `zeus: true` and `parallel: true` into configuration hash, you can play with `bundler: false` option to speed things up)

## TODO

* minitest support
